Week 3-4: Build ML Models
Goals: Create prediction models
Models to Build:
Model 1: Crime Type Classification (Easier)

Predict what TYPE of crime will occur given location/time
Use: Random Forest or XGBoost
Features: hour, day of week, month, neighborhood, weather

Model 2: Hotspot Prediction (Medium)

Predict WHERE crimes will occur
Grid the city into zones
Use: Random Forest for classification (which zones are high-risk)
Features: historical crime density, time periods, demographics

Model 3: Time Series Forecasting (Harder - optional for v1)

Predict WHEN crime spikes will occur
Start with ARIMA (simpler)
If time: Try LSTM
Forecast: weekly/monthly crime volumes

Tasks:

Feature engineering (create useful variables from raw data)
Train/test split (use older data to predict recent data)
Model training and tuning
Evaluate with metrics: accuracy, F1-score, RMSE
Save models (pickle/joblib)

Deliverable: 2-3 trained models with >75% accuracy
